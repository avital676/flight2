flight program:
in our program we made a code that will knew to talk with flight simulator - Flight gear.
our program use the "client server" kind of code, we implemented the server role and client role:

server role-
our server is in charge of get all the relevant values from the simulator and update them in our program.
the server get from the simulator every few seconds the plain values and update them in the data in our
program - so we can use them during the code.

client role-
the client is in charge of update the simulator in all the changes that append in our code-
so the simulator will respond accordingly. after every change we did - we update the simulator (by using a queue)
in order to save our data one and only during the all program we used : 'singelton'.
inside the singelton we implement maps that helps us to search easily.

in the program we got text file us argument from the user. we opened the file and implements roe after
row from the text unteel the text end.
for implenents the code generic we implement class name 'command'. command has a lot if class inherit that all one of
them do what she need to do.  at the end we did execute to every command we have.
